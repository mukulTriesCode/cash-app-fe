## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A moderate blue with purple undertones (#4B49AC) to impart a sense of security and competence.
- Background color: A very pale blue (#F0F8FF) to create a clean, spacious layout. This light background makes the dark text stand out, aiding readability.
- Accent color: A gentle sky blue (#98BDFF), chosen for its proximity on the color wheel to the primary blue but standing out with a bit more brightness, it will subtly direct user attention and enhance key actions without overpowering the visual harmony.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern aesthetic suitable for both headers and body text.
- Use minimalist icons for categories and navigation, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- Employ a responsive layout using flexbox and grid to ensure optimal viewing on various devices.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and interactions to provide a polished user experience.
